3 scenarios;
    if zero exist
        reset curMul = 1
    all positive.
        simply return all product array.
    if negative exist
        there could be odd number of - and even who knows
        so maintain 2 pointers
        curMinMul, curMaxMul and if zero encountered then follow step 1.


Key comparison
        const supposedMinVal = minCurMul * curNum,
            supposedMaxVal = maxCurMul * curNum

        minCurMul = Math.min(supposedMinVal, supposedMaxVal, curNum)
        maxCurMul = Math.max(supposedMinVal, supposedMaxVal, curNum)
