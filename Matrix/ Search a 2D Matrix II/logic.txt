initialLogic
part 1: go diagonally till the value less than target till rowLen and colLen

part 2: if m and n equal 
    check (nextRow,nextCol) === target
        if yes return true
    else
        go through next row 0 to nextRow-1 - recur(binary search)
            ||
        go through next col 0 to nextCol-1 - recur(binary search)
    
else if (m and n unequal)
    if(m>n){
        go through next row 0 to nextRow-1
    }
    else
        go through next col 0 to nextCol-1


part 0: write binary search recur function


// above logic is flawed for test case like [[1,3,5]]

OPTIMISED LOGIC.
START FROM ONE LAST ROW OR COLUMN TO FIRST ROW OR COLUMN.
i.e. row=last, col = 0 and move right and up
or 
    row = 0, col= last and move left and down.
