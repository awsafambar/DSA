in solution1 i used bucket sort but the main issue of not 
100% fast response is because min value is MAX_SAFE_INTEGER. 
and it's huge

    const buckets = Array(numberOfBuckets).fill().map(() => ({
        min: Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER,
        max: -1
    })); 

    this peice of code is actually also increasing time space.

    could be alot easier if just create two buckets. One for min and one for max
