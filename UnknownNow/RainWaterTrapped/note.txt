To remember Efficient solution just remember two things
1. solution will be sum of each value of water tarpped which can be calculated using leftMax and right Max.
    you have to know the leftMax and rightMax at each point. 
2. either water will be tarpped left or water will be trapped right.
    if(height[left]<height[right]) // left trapped possible 
        only possible if leftMax is lower than height[left]

    else
    same for right Water Trapped.

    do it till left < right.

    simple.
