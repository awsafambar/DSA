follow left and right.

keep in mind that maximum water between 0 and 7th position will be
Min(height(0),height(7)) * 7(width)
so dont go from i =0 and all
follow from wide length.
lef=0 and right = n-1


no need of leftMax and rightMax as we don't need the trapped water

//just keep in mind leftwater and rightwater
