i feel divison is the easiest one.
simply precalculate the product and divide the number on each loop and keep the count of 0.
if(0's >1 ) 
simply return empty array
if(0's==1)
simply return empty array with zero value Index as totalMultiply

else
return array dividing each number with totalMultiply

BUT THIS APPORACH IS NOT BEST AS PER DEEP SEEK.

Separate handling is not good so better logic that each place i.e. ith position like at position 4 of total 
array length 9 then 
value[4] = prefixMul[4] * suffixMul[4]
