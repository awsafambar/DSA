whole Logic is in 3 parts. with an array [4, 5, 3, 6, 2, 1]
Lemme illustrate the logic with its reason.
Part 1. Find the first decreasing number from back 
reason. That elemnt will be the point from where everything on right
        is already greater. 
example. Moving left from the end: 1 -> 2 -> 6. Stop!
        6 is greater than 3. The sequence broke. The element 3 is our pivot.
        index of 3 is 2 fron front.
        Because everything to the right of this point is already in its highest 
        possible order (a descending sequence). To get the next order, we need 
        to modify the number at this point.

Part 2. Find the next smallest or closest greater number to the value found in part 1 on the right side or back side only
Reason. Next value would be generated from that value only and it should be from right side.
example. The first number we find that is larger than 3 is 6. This is the successor.
        We will swap the pivot (3) with its successor (6).

Part 3. Reverse  or sort the rememaing right elements to come as increasing order or 
        lowest value for new greater element of part 2.
Reason. Since a new number is to be generated from next grater element, it should start from lowest so 
        reverse the remaining part for array on right side.
example.After the swap, the new suffix is [3, 2, 1]. It is still in descending order.
        To get the smallest possible value for this new suffix (and thus the very next permutation), 
        we must reverse it to get it into ascending order.
        Reversing it gives us [1, 2, 3].
        The Final Result: [4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3]
